## 📋 Quick Start - Test Registration

### Test Admin Registration:
1. Open mobile app → Register tab
2. Fill form:
   - Username: `admintest`
   - Email: `admintest@test.com`
   - Password: `Password123!`
   - Role: **Admin**
   - Group Name: `Test Team`
   - Access Code: `TEAM123`
3. Click "Create Account"
4. ✅ Should succeed with no errors

### Test User Registration:
1. Log out → Register tab
2. Fill form:
   - Username: `usertest`
   - Email: `usertest@test.com`
   - Password: `Password123!`
   - Role: **User**
   - Access Code: `TEAM123`
3. Click "Create Account"
4. ✅ Should succeed and join the group

### Verify in Database:
```sql
SELECT u.email, u.username, u.role, g.name as group_name
FROM public.users u
LEFT JOIN public.groups g ON u.group_id = g.id
WHERE u.email IN ('admintest@test.com', 'usertest@test.com');
```

Expected: Both users have username, role, and group_name filled in.

## 🔧 What Changed

### Database Functions Updated:

1. **`handle_new_user()` trigger**
   - Now extracts username from auth.users metadata
   - Creates public.users with username field populated

2. **`create_admin_group()` RPC**
   - Extracts and preserves username
   - Creates group and sets role='admin'

3. **`redeem_access_code()` RPC**
   - Extracts and preserves username
   - Adds user to group and sets role='user'

4. **`verify_user_setup()` RPC**
   - Returns username in results for verification

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

Before marking this as complete, verify:

- [ ] Admin registration creates user with username, role, and group
- [ ] User registration creates user with username and role
- [ ] User joins correct group using access code
- [ ] No console errors during registration
- [ ] Users can log in after registration
- [ ] Username displays correctly in the app

---

## 🚨 Known Limitations

- Users can only join one group (by design)
- Access codes are case-insensitive but stored uppercase
- No access code expiration (consider adding)
- No duplicate username prevention (consider adding unique constraint)

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If registration fails:

1. **Check console logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify functions are updated:**
   ```sql
   \sf public.handle_new_user
   \sf public.create_admin_group
   \sf public.redeem_access_code
   ```
3. **Check test user data:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM public.verify_user_setup();
   ```
4. **Review detailed docs** in `registration-issues-analysis.md`

---

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** with the testing guide
2. **Use in production** with real credentials
3. **Monitor** for any edge cases
4. **Consider enhancements:**
   - Admin dashboard UI
   - Group management features
   - Access code expiration
   - Email verification
   - Username uniqueness checks
