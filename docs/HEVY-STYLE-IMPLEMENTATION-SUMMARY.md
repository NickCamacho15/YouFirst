## 🔄 Migration Strategy

### Coexistence Approach

Both systems will work side-by-side:

```typescript
// Auto-detect template type
const isSimplified = template.exercises.every(e => e.block_id === null)

if (isSimplified) {
  // New Hevy-style UI
  return <EnhancedWorkoutBuilderModal />
} else {
  // Existing complex UI
  return <ComplexWorkoutBuilder />
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero breaking changes
- ✅ Users can choose preferred workflow
- ✅ Gradual migration path
- ✅ Backwards compatible

## ❓ Open Questions for You

Before starting implementation, please decide:

1. **Exercise Thumbnails:** Use icon font (free, immediate) or real images (better UX, need sourcing)?
   - Recommendation: Start with icons, add images later

2. **Video Instructions:** Required for MVP or Phase 2?
   - Recommendation: Phase 2, link to YouTube initially

3. **Rest Timer Behavior:** Auto-start between sets or manual?
   - Recommendation: Auto-start (Hevy/Strong pattern)

4. **Weight Units:** Support both lbs and kg?
   - Recommendation: Yes, user preference setting

5. **Supersets:** Need in MVP or Phase 2?
   - Recommendation: Phase 2, MVP is already feature-rich

6. **Progressive Overload:** Auto-suggest weight increases?
   - Recommendation: Phase 4, requires history analysis

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Quick Wins
1. **Start with Phase 1** - Exercise library is self-contained and impressive
2. **Use provided code** - It's production-ready, just customize colors
3. **Keep it simple** - Resist urge to over-engineer

### For Long-term Success
1. **Follow the phases** - Don't skip ahead, each builds on previous
2. **Get user feedback** - Test with real users after each phase
3. **Iterate quickly** - Small improvements beat big releases
4. **Maintain both systems** - Some users may prefer complex builder

### For Best Results
1. **Mobile-first** - This is a mobile workout experience
2. **Performance matters** - Smooth animations, fast loading
3. **Offline support** - Workouts happen at gym (poor signal)
4. **Data accuracy** - Double-check set logs, they're critical
