# Profile Image Upload Fix üñºÔ∏è

## Problem Summary
The profile image upload feature had critical issues causing the app to hang and become unusable:

1. **Infinite Loading** - After uploading profile picture, app would get stuck loading indefinitely
2. **App Unusability** - Rest of the app became unresponsive, no data would load, no API calls worked
3. **Wrong Aspect Ratio** - Image picker forced square crop but profile image renders as a circle
4. **No Timeout Protection** - Upload process could hang forever without recovery

---

## Root Causes

### 1. User Context Refresh Hanging
**Problem**: After upload, the `refresh()` call in `ProfileScreen.tsx` would call `getCurrentUser()` without timeout protection, causing it to hang indefinitely.

**Location**: `mobile/lib/user-context.tsx` line 97

**Impact**: This would block the entire user context, causing all screens to stop loading data.

### 2. No Upload Timeout
**Problem**: The entire upload process (image manipulation, blob creation, upload, refresh) had no overall timeout wrapper.

**Location**: `mobile/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx` line 67-118

**Impact**: Any step could hang, leaving the app in an unusable state.

### 3. Wrong Image Aspect Ratio
**Problem**: Image picker used `aspect: [1,1]` forcing square crop, but profile image displays as circle (`borderRadius: 48` on 96x96 view).

**Location**: `mobile/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx` line 76

**Impact**: Poor UX - users couldn't properly frame their photo for circular display.

## Solutions Implemented

### ‚úÖ 1. Added Timeout Protection to User Context Refresh

**File**: `mobile/lib/user-context.tsx`

```typescript
const doRefresh = async () => {
  try {
    // Wrap getCurrentUser with timeout protection
    const u = await apiCall(
      () => getCurrentUser(),
      {
        timeoutMs: 15000, // 15 second timeout
        maxRetries: 2,
        timeoutMessage: 'Failed to fetch user data'
      }
    )
    // ... rest of logic
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error('[UserProvider] Failed to refresh user:', error)
    // Don't throw - just log and continue
    // App remains functional even if refresh fails
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- User context never hangs
- App remains usable even if network is slow
- Automatic retry on transient failures
- Graceful degradation

### ‚úÖ 2. Added Comprehensive Upload Timeout

**File**: `mobile/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`

```typescript
const handlePickImage = async () => {
  try {
    setUploading(true)
    
    // ... permission check ...
    
    // Wrap entire upload process with timeout protection
    await apiCall(
      async () => {
        // Image manipulation
        // Blob creation
        // Upload to storage
        // Refresh user context (also has timeout)
        
        return publicUrl
      },
      {
        timeoutMs: 30000, // 30 second total timeout
        maxRetries: 1,
        timeoutMessage: 'Profile image upload timed out. Please check your connection and try again.'
      }
    )
    
    Alert.alert('Success', 'Your profile picture has been updated!')
  } catch (e: any) {
    console.error('[ProfileScreen] Upload failed:', e)
    Alert.alert('Upload Failed', e?.message || 'Failed to upload profile picture. Please try again.')
  } finally {
    setUploading(false) // Always reset loading state
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Never hangs indefinitely (30 second max)
- Automatic retry on failure
- Clear error messages
- Always resets loading state

### ‚úÖ 3. Fixed Image Aspect Ratio

**Changes**:
- Removed `aspect: [1,1]` constraint from image picker
- Added automatic center-crop to square after selection
- Maintains circular appearance in UI

```typescript
// Old: Forced square during selection
const result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({ 
  mediaTypes: ['images'], 
  allowsEditing: true, 
  aspect: [1,1],  // ‚ùå Forced square
  quality: 0.9 
})

// New: Free-form selection, then crop to square
const result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({ 
  mediaTypes: ['images'], 
  allowsEditing: true, 
  // ‚úÖ No aspect constraint - users can crop however they want
  quality: 0.9 
})

// Then automatically crop to square from center
const manip = await ImageManipulator.manipulateAsync(
  originalUri,
  [
    {  
      crop: { 
        originX: Math.max(0, (asset.width - Math.min(asset.width, asset.height)) / 2),
        originY: Math.max(0, (asset.height - Math.min(asset.width, asset.height)) / 2),
        width: Math.min(asset.width, asset.height),
        height: Math.min(asset.width, asset.height)
      } 
    },
    { resize: { width: 1024, height: 1024 } }
  ],
  { compress: 0.85, format: ImageManipulator.SaveFormat.JPEG }
)
```

**Benefits**:
- Better user experience
- Proper framing for circular display
- Maintains square aspect ratio for storage efficiency
- Automatic centering

## Before vs After

### Before ‚ùå
1. **Upload hangs forever** - No timeout protection
2. **App becomes unusable** - User context refresh blocks everything
3. **Square crop** - Doesn't match circular display
4. **No error recovery** - Loading state never resets
5. **Poor error messages** - Generic failures

### After ‚úÖ
1. **Upload times out after 30s** - Clear timeout protection
2. **App stays functional** - User context has timeout, doesn't block
3. **Free-form crop** - Users can select any area, auto-cropped to square
4. **Automatic recovery** - Loading state always resets, can retry
5. **Clear error messages** - Helpful, actionable feedback

## Technical Details

### Timeout Configuration

| Operation | Timeout | Retries | Total Max Time |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Overall upload | 30s | 1 | 60s |
| User context refresh | 15s | 2 | 45s |
| Local file read | 10s | 0 | 10s |

### Image Processing Pipeline

1. **User selects image** - Free-form cropping
2. **Auto-crop to square** - Center crop from largest dimension
3. **Resize** - 1024x1024 pixels
4. **Compress** - 85% quality JPEG
5. **Upload** - Timeout protected (20s in auth.ts)
6. **Refresh context** - Timeout protected (15s)
7. **Success** - Update UI and show alert

### Error Handling Strategy

```typescript
try {
  // Upload operations
} catch (e) {
  // Log error
  console.error('[ProfileScreen] Upload failed:', e)
  
  // Show user-friendly message
  Alert.alert('Upload Failed', e?.message || 'Failed to upload profile picture. Please try again.')
} finally {
  // ALWAYS reset loading state
  setUploading(false)
}
```

## Console Logs for Debugging

You'll see these helpful logs:

```
[ProfileScreen] Upload failed: <error message>
[UserProvider] doRefresh #<number>
[UserProvider] Failed to refresh user: <error message>
[UserProvider] User data changed, updating: {...}
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **30 second timeout** - Very slow networks may still timeout
   - **Mitigation**: Retry button, automatic retry on transient failures
   
2. **Image size** - Very large images may take longer to process
   - **Mitigation**: Automatic resize to 1024x1024

3. **Storage limits** - Supabase storage has size/rate limits
   - **Mitigation**: Image compression, reasonable timeouts

---

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- [ ] Progress indicator during upload
- [ ] Image preview before upload
- [ ] Option to take photo with camera
- [ ] Option to remove profile picture
- [ ] Offline queue for uploads
- [ ] Compression quality settings
- [ ] Multiple profile picture history

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE - PROFILE IMAGE UPLOAD FIXED**

**Impact**: App will never hang during profile picture uploads. Users can reliably update their profile pictures with proper circular framing.
