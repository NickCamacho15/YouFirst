## 💡 Design Decisions

1. **Separated Planning from Workouts**
   - Planning tab for admins to manage library and assignments
   - Workouts tab for all users to see and complete assigned workouts
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Published vs Draft Status**
   - Only published workouts can be assigned
   - Prevents assigning incomplete/test workouts
   - Admin can prepare workouts before assigning

3. **Multi-Select Assignment Modal**
   - Allows assigning to multiple users at once
   - "Select All" for convenience
   - Visual feedback with checkboxes

4. **Group Members in Planning Tab**
   - Keeps admin workflow in one place
   - Easy to see who's in the group
   - Admins are highlighted with badges

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No Workout Execution Yet**
   - Users can see assigned workouts but can't complete them yet
   - Need to build workout execution screen

2. **No Unassign Feature**
   - Once assigned, can't be removed (yet)
   - Would need unassign button/function

3. **No Assignment Notifications**
   - Users must check Workouts tab manually
   - Future: Push notifications

4. **No Bulk Assignment by Status**
   - Can't assign to "all users" or "all non-admins" with one click
   - Would be a nice enhancement
