# ✅ FINAL FIX APPLIED - Ambiguous "id" Error Resolved

## Issue
Even after previous fixes, registration was still failing with:
```
ERROR: column reference "id" is ambiguous
```

## Root Cause
The functions `create_admin_group()` and `redeem_access_code()` were returning tables with columns named `id`, `name`, `access_code`. When PL/pgSQL creates a function that returns a table, it creates implicit output variables with those names. This caused ambiguity when trying to reference table columns like `groups.id` within the function.

## Solution Applied
Changed the return column names to be more specific and non-conflicting:

### Before:
```sql
returns table (id uuid, name text, access_code text)
```

### After:
```sql
returns table (group_id uuid, group_name text, group_access_code text)
```

This eliminates the ambiguity because there's no longer a conflict between the output variable `id` and table column names.

## Changes Made

1. ✅ Updated `create_admin_group()` to return `group_id`, `group_name`, `group_access_code`
2. ✅ Updated `redeem_access_code()` to return `group_id`, `group_name`
3. ✅ Verified client code doesn't use the returned data (only checks for errors)
4. ✅ Cleaned up test user data

## Test Again

Please try registering with:
- Username: `plzworknow`
- Email: `plzworknow@gmail.com`
- Role: **Admin**
- Group Name: `Plz Work Now`
- Access Code: `PLZNOWWW`

This should now complete successfully without any ambiguous column errors!

## Verification Query

After registration, run this to verify everything worked:

```sql
SELECT 
  u.email, 
  u.username, 
  u.role, 
  g.name as group_name,
  g.access_code
FROM public.users u
LEFT JOIN public.groups g ON u.group_id = g.id
WHERE u.email = 'plzworknow@gmail.com';
```

Expected result:
- username: `plzworknow` ✅
- role: `admin` ✅
- group_name: `Plz Work Now` ✅
- access_code: `PLZNOWWW` ✅

All fields should be filled in!
