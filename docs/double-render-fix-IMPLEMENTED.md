# ✅ Double-Render Fix - IMPLEMENTED

## Status: Ready for Testing

All fixes have been successfully implemented! The mobile app should now load smoothly without any flickers or double-renders.

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. Calendar Component - Fixed Unnecessary Reloads
**File**: `mobile/components/Calendar.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `prevUserIdRef` and `prevMonthRef` to track when user or month actually changes
- Only reset `hasLoadedRef` when user ID or month truly changes (not just object reference)
- Prevents unnecessary data reloads when UserProvider updates user state

**Impact**: Calendar won't reload data unless the user or month actually changes.

---

### 2. UserProvider - Added Debouncing
**File**: `mobile/lib/user-context.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `lastRefreshRef` to track timestamp of last refresh
- Added `REFRESH_DEBOUNCE_MS = 1000` constant (1 second debounce)
- Auth state change handler now checks time since last refresh
- Skips refresh if less than 1 second has passed
- Added debug logging for auth events and refresh calls
- Added comparison logging to `setUser` to show what changed

**Impact**: Prevents rapid-fire duplicate refreshes when multiple auth events fire in quick succession.

---

### 3. App.tsx - Removed UserProvider Remount on Login
**File**: `mobile/App.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed `setAppEpoch((e) => e + 1)` from `handleLogin()`
- Kept `setAppEpoch` increment in `handleLogout()` for clean slate
- Added explanatory comments

**Impact**: UserProvider no longer remounts on every login, eliminating unnecessary state resets.

---

### 4. Warm-Start Caching - Enhanced Pre-loading
**File**: `mobile/lib/warm-start.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added imports for `getWinsForMonth` and `getStreaks`
- Added these functions to the warmup jobs array
- Added explanatory comments

**Impact**: Calendar and StreakStats data is pre-cached during app startup for instant rendering.

---

### 5. Debug Monitoring - Added Counters
**File**: `mobile/lib/user-context.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `refreshCounter` and `authEventCounter` at module level
- Added logging in `doRefresh()`: `[UserProvider] doRefresh #N`
- Added logging in auth state change listener: `[UserProvider] Auth event #N: EVENT_NAME`
- Added logging for debounce skips
- Added detailed logging for user comparison results

**Impact**: Easy to see exactly how many refreshes are happening and which auth events are firing.

---

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Before (Broken):
```
Login → UserProvider remounts
  ↓ Load from cache → Data appears ✅
  ↓ doRefresh #1 completes
  ↓ SIGNED_IN event → skipped (initialLoadDoneRef=false)
  ↓ Set initialLoadDoneRef=true
  ↓ TOKEN_REFRESHED event → doRefresh #2 ⚡
  ↓ Calendar reloads → Data disappears ❌
  ↓ Load completes → Data reappears ✅
  = FLICKER!
```

### After (Fixed):
```
Login → UserProvider stays mounted
  ↓ Load from cache → Data appears ✅
  ↓ doRefresh #1 completes
  ↓ SIGNED_IN event → doRefresh #2 starts
  ↓ Set initialLoadDoneRef=true
  ↓ TOKEN_REFRESHED event → DEBOUNCED (< 1 second) ✅
  ↓ User data unchanged → same reference kept ✅
  ↓ Calendar doesn't reset → No reload ✅
  = NO FLICKER!
```

4. Observe home screen load

**Expected:**
- ✅ Startup overlay shows briefly

### Test 5: Token Refresh During Session
**Steps:**

**Pass/Fail:** ___________

---

## Console Output to Look For

### Good Signs (Expected):
```
[UserProvider] Auth event #1: SIGNED_IN
[UserProvider] doRefresh #1
[UserProvider] User data unchanged, keeping same reference to prevent re-renders
[UserProvider] Auth event #2: TOKEN_REFRESHED
[UserProvider] Skipping refresh for TOKEN_REFRESHED - only 234ms since last refresh
```

### Bad Signs (Problems):
```
[UserProvider] doRefresh #1
[UserProvider] doRefresh #2
[UserProvider] doRefresh #3  ← TOO MANY!
[UserProvider] User data changed, updating: { ... }  ← Why did data change?
```

---

## Success Metrics

### Before (Current State):
- ❌ 2-3 doRefresh calls per login
- ❌ Visible 1-2 second flicker
- ❌ Components reload data multiple times
- ❌ Unprofessional UX

### After (Fixed - Target):
- ✅ 1 doRefresh call per login
- ✅ Zero visible flicker
- ✅ Components load data once
- ✅ Production-grade smooth UX
- ✅ Instant perceived load time

---

## What to Watch In Console

1. **Refresh Counter**: Should be 1 (maybe 2 max) after login
2. **Auth Event Counter**: Will be 2-3, but most should skip refresh
3. **User Data Changes**: Should see "unchanged, keeping same reference"
4. **Debounce Messages**: Should see "Skipping refresh" for rapid events

---

## Debugging Tips

If you still see issues:

1. **Check refresh counter**: If > 2, something is triggering extra refreshes
2. **Check auth events**: If multiple non-debounced refreshes, may need longer debounce
3. **Check user comparisons**: If data keeps changing, investigate why
4. **Check Calendar logs**: Add logging to see when it's reloading

---

## Rollback Instructions

If something goes wrong, you can rollback individual changes:

### Rollback Phase 1 (Calendar):
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- mobile/components/Calendar.tsx
```

### Rollback Phase 2 (UserProvider):
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- mobile/lib/user-context.tsx
```

### Rollback Phase 3 (App.tsx):
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- mobile/App.tsx
git checkout HEAD -- mobile/lib/warm-start.ts
```

### Rollback Everything:
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- mobile/components/Calendar.tsx mobile/lib/user-context.tsx mobile/App.tsx mobile/lib/warm-start.ts
```

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run through all test cases above
2. ✅ Check console logs match expected patterns
3. ✅ Verify metrics (1 refresh per login, no flicker)
4. ✅ Test on multiple devices if available
5. ✅ Test with slow network (throttle in dev tools)
6. ✅ Once confirmed working, REMOVE debug logs (optional)

---

## Removing Debug Logs (Optional)

After confirming the fix works, you can clean up the logs:

**In `mobile/lib/user-context.tsx`:**
- Remove lines 18-20 (counter declarations)
- Remove line 56 (auth event logging)
- Remove line 89 (doRefresh counter logging)
- Remove lines 105-113 (user comparison detailed logging) or simplify to just line 102

Keep the debounce logic and the line 72 "Skipping refresh" log (it's useful for debugging).

**Status**: ✅ Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing

**Next Action**: Run through test checklist and report results!
