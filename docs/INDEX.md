## 💬 Questions & Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to implement all phases at once?**  
A: No! Start with Phase 1 (exercise library), validate with users, then proceed.

**Q: Will this break my existing workout features?**  
A: No! The coexistence strategy ensures backwards compatibility.

**Q: Can I customize the UI colors/styles?**  
A: Yes! The design system is in `HEVY-STYLE-UI-SPECIFICATIONS.md` - adjust as needed.

**Q: What if I want to add custom features?**  
A: The architecture is extensible. Add your features as Phase 5+.

**Q: How long until production-ready?**  
A: 4 weeks (all 4 phases) + 1 week testing = ~5-6 weeks total.
