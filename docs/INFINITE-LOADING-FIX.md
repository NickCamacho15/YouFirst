# Infinite Loading States - Fix Summary

## Problem
The app was experiencing infinite loading states that never resolved, causing the app to become unusable. Specifically:

1. **Workouts tab** - "Loading your workouts..." would never complete
2. **Planning tab** - "Loading workouts..." and "Loading members..." would hang indefinitely
3. **General issue** - After the app was open for a while or in the background, API calls would hang without timing out
4. **No recovery** - Users had to close and reopen the app to fix the issue

## Root Causes

1. **No timeout handling** - Supabase API calls could hang indefinitely without throwing errors
2. **Stale connections** - When the app was in the background, database connections would become stale but weren't refreshed
3. **No retry mechanism** - Failed API calls had no automatic retry logic
4. **No manual refresh** - Users couldn't manually refresh data when stuck

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created API Utilities (`mobile/lib/api-utils.ts`)

Added robust wrapper functions for all API calls:

- **`withTimeout()`** - Wraps promises with a configurable timeout (default 15s)
- **`withRetry()`** - Automatically retries failed requests with exponential backoff
- **`apiCall()`** - Combines timeout + retry for robust API calls

Example usage:
```typescript
const data = await apiCall(
  () => listWorkoutTemplates(statusFilter),
  {
    timeoutMs: 15000,        // 15 second timeout
    maxRetries: 2,           // Retry up to 2 times
    timeoutMessage: 'Custom error message'
  }
)
```

### 2. Updated Components with Timeout Handling

Updated all loading components to use the new API utilities:

- ✅ **AssignedWorkoutsList** - Workouts tab loading
- ✅ **BodyScreen** - Planning tab workout library loading
- ✅ **GroupMembersList** - Members list loading

### 3. Added App State Refresh Listeners

All components now automatically refresh when the app comes back to foreground:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = AppState.addEventListener('change', nextAppState => {
    if (
      appState.current.match(/inactive|background/) &&
      nextAppState === 'active'
    ) {
      console.log('App came to foreground, refreshing...')
      loadData()
    }
    appState.current = nextAppState
  })

  return () => subscription.remove()
}, [])
```

This ensures that when you:
- Switch apps and come back
- Lock your phone and unlock it
- Put the app in background and return

The data will automatically refresh with fresh connections.

### 4. Added Pull-to-Refresh

Added `RefreshControl` to the main `BodyScreen` ScrollView:

- Pull down on any tab to manually refresh data
- Visual feedback with loading spinner
- Works on Profile, Workouts, and Planning tabs

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Timeout Handling
- [ ] Open the app with airplane mode ON
- [ ] Navigate to Workouts tab
- [ ] Verify loading state displays for ~15 seconds then shows error message
- [ ] Verify "Retry" button appears and works when network is restored

### Test 2: App State Refresh
- [ ] Open the app and navigate to Workouts tab
- [ ] Wait for data to load
- [ ] Press home button (put app in background)
- [ ] Wait 30+ seconds
- [ ] Return to app
- [ ] Verify data refreshes automatically (check console logs)

### Test 3: Pull-to-Refresh
- [ ] Open any tab (Profile, Workouts, or Planning)
- [ ] Pull down from the top of the screen
- [ ] Verify loading spinner appears
- [ ] Verify data refreshes successfully

### Test 4: Extended Background Time
- [ ] Open the app
- [ ] Let it sit in background for 5+ minutes
- [ ] Return to app
- [ ] Navigate through tabs
- [ ] Verify all tabs load correctly without hanging

### Test 5: Network Recovery
- [ ] Turn on airplane mode
- [ ] Try to load any tab (should fail with timeout)
- [ ] Turn off airplane mode
- [ ] Tap retry button or pull to refresh
- [ ] Verify data loads successfully

## Technical Details

### Timeout Configuration

All API calls now have these defaults:
- **Timeout**: 15-20 seconds
- **Max retries**: 2 attempts
- **Retry delay**: 1 second (exponential backoff)

You can adjust these in each component if needed.

### Console Logging

Added helpful console logs for debugging:
```
[AssignedWorkoutsList] App came to foreground, refreshing...
[BodyScreen] App came to foreground, refreshing current tab...
[GroupMembersList] App came to foreground, refreshing...
```

### Error Messages

Improved error messages to be more user-friendly:
- ❌ Before: "Failed to load workouts"
- ✅ After: "Failed to load workouts. Please check your connection and try again."

## Files Modified

1. **`mobile/lib/api-utils.ts`** - NEW: API utilities library
2. **`mobile/components/workout/AssignedWorkoutsList.tsx`** - Added timeout + app state refresh
3. **`mobile/components/workout/GroupMembersList.tsx`** - Added timeout + app state refresh
4. **`mobile/screens/BodyScreen.tsx`** - Added timeout, app state refresh, and pull-to-refresh

## Future Improvements

Consider adding similar fixes to:
- GoalsScreen (already has caching, but could benefit from timeouts)
- MindScreen (meditation/reading sessions)
- DisciplinesScreen
- Any other screens with data loading

## Notes

- The app should never hang indefinitely anymore
- All loading states will either succeed, fail with error, or timeout after 15-20 seconds
- Users can always retry or pull-to-refresh to recover
- Automatic refresh when returning from background prevents stale data issues

---

**Issue Resolved**: App should no longer experience infinite loading states that require restart.
