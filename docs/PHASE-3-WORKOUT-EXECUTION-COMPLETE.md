# Phase 3: Workout Execution - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview

Phase 3 implements the complete user workout execution flow, allowing users to perform assigned workouts with real-time set logging, rest timers, and progress tracking.

## What Was Built

### 1. Service Layer

**File**: `/mobile/lib/workout-session.ts`

Core functions for workout session management:
- `startWorkoutSession(planId)` - Create new workout session from template
- `getActiveSession()` - Get current in-progress workout
- `logSet()` - Record completed set with actual reps/weight
- `skipSet()` - Mark a set as skipped
- `completeExercise()` - Mark exercise as done
- `completeSession()` - Finish workout and calculate stats
- `abortSession()` - Quit workout early
- `getPreviousExerciseData()` - Load last workout data for "Previous" column

### 2. UI Components

#### SetLogRow Component
**File**: `/mobile/components/workout/SetLogRow.tsx`

Individual set logging interface:
- Set number display
- Previous performance (from last workout)
- Editable weight and reps inputs
- Checkbox to mark as completed
- Green highlight for completed sets
- Red highlight for skipped sets

#### RestTimer Component
**File**: `/mobile/components/workout/RestTimer.tsx`

Modal rest timer:
- Countdown display (MM:SS format)
- Skip rest button
- Add 30s button to extend
- Auto-dismisses when complete
- Slides up from bottom

#### WorkoutSummaryModal Component
**File**: `/mobile/components/workout/WorkoutSummaryModal.tsx`

Celebratory completion screen:
- Trophy icon celebration
- Duration display
- Exercises completed count

### 3. Main Workout Screen

**File**: `/mobile/screens/ActiveWorkoutScreen.tsx`

Complete workout execution interface:
- **Header**: Elapsed time + exercise progress (e.g., "Exercise 2 of 5")
- **Exercise Display**: Current exercise name, type, icon
- **Progress Bar**: Visual progress through sets
- **Set Table**: 
  - Headers: Set | Previous | Reps | lbs
  - Rows for each set with inputs
  - Checkboxes to mark complete
- **Rest Timer**: Auto-appears after each set

- **Quit Button**: Abort workout with confirmation

### 4. Integration

**File**: `/mobile/screens/BodyScreen.tsx`

Added workout start functionality:
- Import workout-session service
- `handleStartWorkout()` function
- Check for existing active session
- Create new session from template
- Navigate to ActiveWorkoutScreen
- Connected to AssignedWorkoutsList

- total_volume
```

### session_exercises

- set_details (JSONB - per-set targets)
- started_at, completed_at
```

### set_logs

## Navigation Setup Required

To fully integrate, add to your navigation stack:

```typescript

import ActiveWorkoutScreen from './screens/ActiveWorkoutScreen'

// Add to stack
<Stack.Screen 
  name="ActiveWorkout" 
  component={ActiveWorkoutScreen}
  options={{ headerShown: false }}
/>
```

Then pass navigation prop to BodyScreen:

```typescript
<BodyScreen 
  onLogout={handleLogout}
  onOpenProfile={handleOpenProfile}
  navigation={navigation}  // ‚Üê Add this
/>
```
